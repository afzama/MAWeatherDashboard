# MAWeatherDashboard

## User Story
As a world traverler, I want to navigate to MAWeatherDashboard to check the current and forecasted weather conditions of the next city I am travelling to.

## Code Description
This respository contains HTML, CSS and Javascript and uses the weather api to fetch weather data. The deployed webpage uses application local storage to read user entered city.

## References
1. Refered to the [Day.js Docs] (https://day.js.org/docs/en/display/format) to set dates on webpage
2. Referenced Fetch API MDN web docs to set-up application fetch function (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)
3. Spent time with tutor, Wesley Clements to solve for fetching api error 400. Learnt about correctly formating the apiUrl in JS.
